### Hi Just Get Me Online ###
Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

This is because of this genius guy and his source: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/
